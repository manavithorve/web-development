    <div>Hello I am Manavi, instead of starting with my personal details I would like to directly jump on 
        technical skills. I am passionate about web development and I have made 3 web based projects.
        Apart from that I can make mobile app using Flutter. Being a developer I think the best thing I have learnt 
        so far is VCS. I use Git and Github regularly.

    <div>So let's talk about HTML. HTML stands for hypertext markup language. It has ability to markup the plain text 
        to enhance the presentation of information. It is simply building block of webpage!
